# python-for-engineers: an open-source python toolkit for engineers

### Scope and Motivation:

- What is the main purpose of this repo? (Scope)
    1) Easily setup a local or remote developtment enviornment (one that is visual and intuative)
    2) Securely interact with git and remote systems by using ssh-keys
    
- Why would I want to do this? (Motivation / Benifits of this setup)
    1) fast iterative developtment on a variety of platforms (servers down to raspberry-pi)
    2) intuative git integration
    3) By leveraging containers we will ensure our work is easily deployable on a variety of platforms

TODO: integrate colab, in a smooth git-friendly way
TODO: look for a better git visualization tool, mainly for managing branches (current workaround is to use sourcetree on windows, for branch management)
